# FoodPantrySite
Website for the Food Pantry

Plan:
* The website will be hosted on an AWS LightSail server.
* Instead of using LAMP, it will use Node.js, since it will be easier to integrate CI and run server side code.
* It will use SASS for CSS preprocessing. Can be installed with Node.JS
* It will use TypeScript as a JS dialect. Can be installed with Node.JS

A batch script will be made to make testing and deploying easier
