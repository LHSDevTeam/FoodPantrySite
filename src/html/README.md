# HTML Directory
Any folder in this directory that includes an `index.html` file will be part of the website. The HTML files can then link to `../css/out/index.css` for styles and the respective JavaScript file for logic.\
Common attributes of the HTML files include:\
`<meta charset="UTF-8">` for consistancy\
`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">` for resizing\
`<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../../css/out/index.css">` for styles
